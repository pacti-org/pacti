To insert *local* figures (PNG or JPG), follow the conversion to Base64 technique described here: https://mljar.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-insert-image/

Note: Inserting *.SVG as Base64 figures will render locally with `make docs-serve` only.
Github's ipynb rendering will show only an icon, not the SVG image.
