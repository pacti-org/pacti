    "# Topology generation for UAV designs using Pacti\n",

    "\n",
    "We demonstrate how pacti can be utilized to generate designs for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) under a set of predefined \"design rules\". Our primary objective is to produce a 3D grid, consisting of interconnected points that represent the abstract topology of the UAV. Each point within the grid represents a specific component of the UAV, such as fuselage, wing, rotor, etc., while each edge between two points depicts the connection among components. To achieve this, we employ a context-sensitive grammar (CSG) that formalizes the placement of UAV components on the grid based on their local context, i.e., the components around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our grammar's primary goal is to generate all legal configurations of components and their connections within the 3D grid. A context-sensitive grammar (CSG) is a formal grammar that describes a formal language through a set of rules that define how strings of symbols within the language can be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we introduce the main building blocks of our grammar: grid, context, symbols, and rules. By leveraging these components, our proposed method generates UAV designs that adhere to predefined design rules, resulting in functional and efficient UAV designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3D grid of points, or simply a grid, can be formally defined as a set of ordered triplets, where each triplet represents a point in 3D space. The triplet is composed of three integer coordinates $(x, y, z)$ that specify the position of the point in the 3D grid. Let $n_{half} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and let $G = {(x, y, z) | x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{Z}, -n_{half} \\leq x, y, z \\leq n_{half}}$ be the set of all points in a 3D grid. We define the size of a grid $G$ as $|G| = ((n_{half} * 2) + 1)^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we present an example of a grid of size 27, and we highlight the middle point of the grid, which has coordinates $(0,0,0)$:\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FormalSystems/media/main/case_studies/uav_topologies/grid-1.png\" alt=\"grid\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the defined grid structure, we can easily specify the position of each component of the UAV in the form of a 3D point. This facilitates the use of a context-sensitive grammar to formalize the placement of components on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a 3D grid of points, we define the context of a point $p$ as a tuple of seven points, where six points are the coordinates of the adjacent points in the grid and one point is $p$ itself. We define a set of seven directions $\\Delta = (\\texttt{ego}, \\texttt{front}, \\texttt{rear}, \\texttt{left}, \\texttt{right}, \\texttt{top}, \\texttt{bottom})$. Given a point $p = (x, y, z)$, we can construct its context $Ctx(p) = (p_\\texttt{ego}, p_\\texttt{front}, p_\\texttt{rear}, p_\\texttt{left}, p_\\texttt{right}, p_\\texttt{top}, p_{bottom})$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p_\\texttt{ego} &= (x, y, z) \\\\\n",
    "p_\\texttt{front} &= (x, y+1, z) \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the points at the edge of the grid have contexts with some points having coordinates outside the grid, i.e., the points adjacent to them in the specified direction are not included in the grid. The context of a point is used to define the placement of components of an UAV in the grid according to their local context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "In our grammar, each point $p$ in the grid is associated with a symbol, denoted by $Sym(p)$. The symbols are divided into two main categories: terminal symbols and nonterminal symbols. Terminal symbols represent actual characters or words in the language that the grammar defines, while nonterminal symbols are used to represent groups or structures in the language. These symbols can be expanded or rewritten by the production rules of the grammar to generate strings in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the set of terminal symbols as $\\Lambda$, which contains five elements that mostly represent UAV components: ${\\texttt{Fuselage}, \\texttt{Rotor}, \\texttt{Wing}, \\texttt{Connector}, \\texttt{Empty}}$. We define the set of nonterminal symbols as $\\Theta$, which contains one element: ${\\texttt{Unoccupied}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that although $\\texttt{Empty}$ and $\\texttt{Unoccupied}$ represent the same concept (i.e., the absence of a component), they are different symbols. $\\texttt{Empty}$ is terminal, meaning it cannot be expanded into a new symbol, while $\\texttt{Unoccupied}$ is nonterminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "At initialization, all points in the grid are associated with the $\\texttt{Unoccupied}$ symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "We associate each symbol with a color, as shown in the figure below:\n",

    "A local context $LC=(sym_1, sym_2, \\dots, sym_7)$ is a tuple of seven symbols, i.e. $l_c \\in \\Lambda \\cup \\Theta$, one for each direction in $\\Delta$.

    "### State\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of a point $p$ on a grid is the local context around that point, denoted by $S(p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the grid depicted below, let us consider the point $p=(0,0,0)$. We have that $S(p)=(\\texttt{Fuselage}, \\texttt{Unoccupied}, \\texttt{Unoccupied}, \\texttt{Wing}, \\texttt{Wing}, \\texttt{Rotor}, \\texttt{Unoccupied})$.

    "\n",
    "In our grammar, a production rule, or simply a rule, defines how a single nonterminal symbol can be substituted with another non-terminal symbol based on its context.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rule $R_i = (\\Omega, \\Pi)$ consists of a condition $\\Omega$ and a production $\\Pi$, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\Omega=\\{LC_0, LC_1, ..., LC_c\\}$ is a set of $c$ local contexts.\n",
    "2. $\\Pi = (sym, \\texttt{dir})$ where $sym \\in \\Lambda$ and $\\texttt{dir} \\in \\Delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition $\\Omega$ determines all the local contexts where the rule can be applied. The production $\\Pi$ specifies the nonterminal symbol $sym \\in Tau$ to be produced and the direction of the edge that connects the newly generated symbol to one of the adjacent symbols in the grid. If no connection is required, then $\\texttt{dir}$ is simply $\\texttt{ego}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step, we apply a rule to a point in the grid.\n",
    "A rule $R_i$ _matches_ with a point $p$ if the local context of $p$, i.e. $S(p)$, is a subset of the conditions of $R_i$, i.e. if $S(p) \\subseteq \\Omega$. If a rule $R_i = (\\Omega, \\Pi)$ matches with a point $p$, then the production $\\Pi$ is applied to the point $p$. That is, let $\\Pi=(sym, p_{dir})$, then the symbol $sym$ is placed in $p$, i.e. $Sym(p)=sym$, and an edge is created from $p$ to $p_{dir}$. The figure below shows an example of a grid at a time step $t$, where a point $p$ matches a rule $R_i$, and the production of $R_i$ is applied to $p$, modifying the state of the grid in the next time step $t+1$.\n",

    "Given $n$ rules, a grammar $Gr={R_0, R_1, \\dots , R_n}$ is simply the set of all rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a grid where all points are associated with the nonterminal symbol _Unassigned_. Then, at discrete time-steps, we choose a point in the grid and try to match it with one or more rules in the grammar. If a rule matches the local context of the chosen point, we apply the production of the rule to the point, which changes its nonterminal symbol and potentially creates edges between adjacent points. We repeat this process until all points contain nonterminal symbols or until we have no rules matching in the grammar.\n"
