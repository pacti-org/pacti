We present a case study to evaluate the perception system of an autonomous car.

# Trajectory planning for multi-agent systems
![](_case_studies/multiagent_coordination/multiagent_overview.png)

A case study on multi-agent path finding (MAPF) where multiple agents need to reach their target location on a grid world according to a conflict-free strategy.
We will treat each time step as our viewpoint to find a solution that satisfies the agents' dynamics and collision constraints using the _merge_ operator.


# Specification-based synthetic biology

A case study on modeling the specifications of biological sensors to construct a library of parts and guide biocircuit design.

# Signal processing pipelines in digital ICs
