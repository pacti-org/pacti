# Case Studies
In the following sections we will present case studies that illustrate the use of pacti for different applications.

We present a case study to evaluate the perception system of an autonomous car using the _quotient_ operator.

A case study on multi-agent path finding (MAPF) where multiple agents need to reach their target location on a grid world according to a conflict-free strategy.
We will treat each time step as our viewpoint to find a solution that satisfies the agents' dynamics and collision constraints using the _merge_ operator.

<font size="5">[**Specification-based synthetic biology**](/pacti/_case_studies/biocircuit_specifications/specification_based_synthetic_biology/)</font>

A case study on modeling the specifications of biological sensors to construct a library of parts and guide biocircuit design.
