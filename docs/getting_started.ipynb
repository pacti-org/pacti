    "Pacti helps designers to reason about specifications and to manipulate them. These specifications are given to Pacti as assume-guarantee contracts, which are requirements of the form (assumptions, guarantees).\n",
    "\n",
    "For Pacti, every contract has four elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input variables\n",
    "- Output variables\n",
    "- Assumptions: constraints whose satisfaction requires the object under specification to deliver the contract's guarantees. In Pacti, assumptions can only refer to the input variables of the contract.\n",
    "- Guarantees: constraints that the object under specification can be expected to deliver when the contract's assumptions are met. In Pacti, guarantees can only refer to the input or output variables of the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *interface* of a contract is the set of its input and output variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algebra of contracts has been extensively researched and peer-reviewed by experts—see [Benveniste et al. 2018](#ref1), [Incer 2022](#ref2), and references therein.\n",
    "Contracts provide mathematical rigor to several tasks of relevance to system design. The algebra of contracts contains operations that generate new contracts from existing ones, i.e., the algebra is closed under these operations. We can use the algebra of contracts to address the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Building systems.** Suppose that we have specified contracts for a set of subsystems. We can define a system as the assembly of such subsystems. The operation of *composition* allows us to compute the contract of such a system from the contracts of the assembled subsystems. In other words, composition provides a mechanism for computing system contracts from subsystem contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Patching systems.** The operation of *quotient* allows us to compute the contract of a subsystem that needs to be composed with an existing subsystem so that the resulting system composition meets a top-level contract. In other words, the quotient finds contracts of missing subsystems from contracts for the system and a partial implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validity of decompositions.** *Refinement* allows us to tell when a contract is more relaxed, or less demanding than another. When a subsystem satisfies a contract, it is guaranteed to satisfy a more relaxed contract. When a system contract is broken into an assembly of subsystem contracts, refinement allows us to tell whether this decomposition is a valid refinement of the system-level contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fusing viewpoints.** The operation of *merging* allows us to generate a single contract whose assumptions and guarantees require the satisfaction of the assumptions and guarantees of the merged contracts, respectively. In other words, merging fuses multiple contract viewpoints, a common operation in concurrent design.\n",
