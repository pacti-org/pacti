    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pacti helps designers to reason about specifications and to manipulate them. These specifications are given to Pacti as assume-guarantee contracts, which are requirements of the form (assumptions, guarantees).\n",
    "\n",
    "For Pacti, every contract has four elements:\n",
    "- Input variables\n",
    "- Output variables\n",
    "- Assumptions\n",
    "- Guarantees\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions of a contract are only allowed to refer to the input variables. Guarantees are only allowed to refer to the input and output variables of the contract, i.e., no variables outside the interface of the contract may appear in the assumptions or guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algebra of contracts has been extensively researched. This algebra allows us to compute new specifications from existing contracts. For example,\n",
    "- The operation of composition allows us to compute the specification of the system formed by composing subsystems obeying the specifications being composed. In other words, composition is the system-building operation.\n",
    "- The operation of quotient allows us to compute the specification of a component that needs to be composed with an existing subsystem so that the resulting system meets a top-level specification. Quotient is used to find missing-component specifications.\n",
    "- The operation of merging is used to generate a single contract that simultaneously enforces the assumptions and guarantees of the contracts being merged. This is used to fuse contract viewpoints in concurrent design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing system specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following system:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"source/_static/exports/circuit_series_composition_background.svg\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Components $M$ and $M'$ obey, respectively, contracts $C = (|i| \\le 2, o \\le i \\le 2o + 2)$ and $C' = (-1 \\le o \\le 1/5, o' \\le o)$. We can use Pacti to obtain the specification of the system that comprises these two components as follows: "
